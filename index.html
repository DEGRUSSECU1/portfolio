        <h2>Profile</h2>
      <p>
        I am a determined, hardworking, and self-motivated person. Eager to
        learn something new every day improving myself to be better than the day
        before. Being part of the School of Code has given me the technical
        skills foundations to pursue my career aspirations in the tech industry
        as a Full Stack Developer, now aspiring to further my growth in a
        professional environment.<br />
        I believe that the soft skills I have developed as collaborative
        teamwork, decision making, fast adaptability from previous employment
        make me valuable in team driven environment.

        <h2>Experience</h2>
      <p>
        In my experience I have gained an understanding of the principles of
        software development, how to apply computational thinking, agile
        fundamentals in a collaborative development team as well as test driven
        development, problem solving and user experience when developing
        software. I have worked in different types of projects during my learning process, alone
        and within teams implementing methodologies such as Kanban, TDD, object
        oriented programming along with practices such as pair programming.
